Common functions I use

# Exports
This package includes a few small R tidbits that I frequently need to use and got tired of copying and pasting across scripts.

*BasicTheme* is a classic ggplot theme with size 14 axis names and size 12 axis labels. Axis line width = 1.

*KellyCols* is a vector with the names of Kelly's colos of maximum contrast. I got the list from Ken Johnson's comment here: https://gist.github.com/ollieglass/f6ddd781eeae1d24e391265432297538#gistcomment-2102654
